## [Cron Jobs](https://github.com/robwayne/BashScripts/tree/master/cron%20jobs)


A list of scripts that are used for either daily or weekly cron jobs. Used to schedule the running of the [python scripts](https://github.com/robwayne/PythonScripts). 


### [cron.daily](https://github.com/robwayne/BashScripts/tree/master/cron%20jobs/cron.daily)


List of scripts that are run on a daily basis that interact with or call the list of python scripts that are needed to perform daily computer maintenance, e.g. [checkDiskSpace.py](https://github.com/robwayne/PythonScripts/tree/master/checkDiskSpace)

> Scripts reside in the  `/etc/cron.daily` directory.

List of scripts that are run on a weekly basis that interact with or call the list of python scripts that are needed to perform daily computer maintenance, e.g. [purge.py](https://github.com/robwayne/PythonScripts/tree/master/purge)
